### 1. One-Way ANOVA to compare penguin flipper lengths

Look at the penguin picture
![](penguin-heights.jpg)

Read in data, get some counts, etc...
```{r}
penguins <- read_csv("penguins.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()

```

For different groups of interest, how many observations exist. Use the count function.
Find some counts based on species and sex
```{r}

penguin_counts <- penguins %>% 
  count(species, sex)

```

For this example we are only going to look at female penguins
Question: Is there a significant difference in mean flipper lenfght for female penguins across the three species?

First create a subset that only contains observations for female penguins, then visually explore the distributions for each species to check for normality (normal distribution)
```{r}
# Create subset with only female penguins
penguin_f <- penguins %>% 
  filter(sex == "FEMALE")

# Visually explore the distributions of flipper lengths for the three species:

# First a histogram: looks normally distributed
ggplot(penguin_f, aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~species)

# Now a quantile-quantile plot: linear, looks normally distributed

ggplot(penguin_f, aes(sample = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_qq() +
  facet_wrap(~species)

# Sample size is greater than 30 so Central Limit Theorem holds, so a Parametric test is probably good

# Everything looks close to normally distrubted, all groups n > 30 so lets use a parametric one-way ANOVA to compare flipper lengths. 

```

Next lets look at some summary statistics using group_by and summarize


```{r}
# look at the mean, standard deviation, sample size, standard error, variance

penguin_f_summary <- penguin_f %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm),
    sd_flipper_length = sd(flipper_length_mm),
    sample_size = n(),
    se_flipper_length = sd(flipper_length_mm) / sqrt(n()),
    var_flipper_length = var(flipper_length_mm)
  )
```


Levene's test: comparing ratios of variance between groups
```{r}
# Comparing variance in flipper length as a function of species
leveneTest(flipper_length_mm ~ species, data = penguin_f)

# Null hypothesis: There is no significant difference in variance in flipper length
# P value is .05782 so we cannot reject the null. Retain the null hypothesis of equal variances.  
```

We're going to make a beeswarm plot with mean and standard deviation overlayed

```{r}
#beeswarm is like a jitter plot but width is associated with number of observations at that level

ggplot() +
  geom_beeswarm(data = penguin_f, 
                aes(x = species,
                    y = flipper_length_mm),
                size = 3, 
                alpha = 0.6,
                pch = 16,
                color = "gray60") +#  Now i'm going to change the labels on the x axis tick marks!!!!
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c( "Adelie", "Chinstrap", "Gentoo")) + # now i'm going to indicate the mean
  geom_point(data = penguin_f_summary, 
             aes(x = species,
                 y = mean_flipper_length),
             color = "red") + # Now plotting data spread (errorbar), 1 standard deviation up and down from mean (standard error and 95% coonfidence interval are also very common)
  geom_errorbar(data = penguin_f_summary,
                aes(x = species,
                    ymin = mean_flipper_length - sd_flipper_length,
                    ymax = mean_flipper_length + sd_flipper_length),
                width = 0.1) +
  theme_light() 



```
**Figure 1.** Flipper lengths (Mm) for Adelie (n = ), Chinstrap (n = ), and Gentoo (n = ) penguins at Palmer Station, Antartcica. Means indicated by black points; error bars indicate $\pm$ 1 standard deviation. Data source:

Now actually run a one-way ANOVA
```{r}
penguin_aov <- aov(flipper_length_mm ~ species, data = penguin_f)

summary(penguin_aov)
# There IS a significant difference in mean flipper lengths between Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins at Palmer Station (F(2, 162) = 411.8, p < 0.0001).
```
The very large F value and very small p value tells us that the spread between groups is much much larger than the spread within groups. So the we reject the null hypothesis, and state that the there is a difference in means.

Just a heads up: The default aov function in r runs a type 1 ANOVA which assumes sample sizes are pretty balanced

We know they are not all the same, now we want to see which ones are different. 
So follow up with poc-hoc test to tell which ones are different.

```{r}
TukeyHSD(penguin_aov)
```
p adj shows the hypothesis test. All the p adj values are very very small, aka they are all significantly different.

One-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey's HSD reveals a significant difference in mean female flipper length between all 3 species (Gentoo, Adelie, Chinstrap). Then we would either have a table or text showing what the actual differences are and then show the stats results. 


### PART 2: Tables and proprortions and chi-square
# Using the built in gss_cat data 

```{r}

party_relig <- gss_cat %>% 
  filter(partyid %in% c("Strong republican", "Strong democrat")) %>% 
  filter(relig %in% c("None", "Catholic")) %>% 
  count(partyid, relig)

#now create a contingency table
#what column are you expanding to multiple columns. take from the relig column and spread those out so they become the column names, values are from wherever the values exist
party_relig_table <- party_relig %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = relig,
              values_from = n)

```

Janitor can calculate percentages for you, put them into percentage format and stick the actual count alongisde it so we can make a table without very much effort.

Now lets make a nice table of counts and proportions within each group:
```{r}
party_relig_prop <- party_relig_table %>% #use adorn funciton. across each party affiliation what percentage said none, and what said catholic
  janitor::adorn_percentages(denominator = "row") %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 1) %>% #show the actual values 
  adorn_ns(position = "front")

party_relig_prop

#Now convert to a kableExtra table

kable(party_relig_prop) %>% 
  kable_styling()

```
Chi-square test for independence
Asking are two nominal categories independent of each other?

Chi square takes into account sample size in groups, and asks if the proportions are different enough to be significant 

Ex. likelyhoood cats or dogs will have heartworm 

I want to look at this in proportions

Run Chi-square test for independence.
First, get only a contingency table (values only; no additional columns)

```{r}
chi_counts <- party_relig_table %>% 
  select(-partyid)

chi_counts

#what am I actually asking?

```
A couple ways to ask a question that would prompt chi-square:
- Is there a significant difference in religious affiliation (none/Catholic) between strong democrats and strong republicans? ie. how different are the proportions?

-Is there a significant association between party affiliation (strong dem/strong republican) on religious affiliation(none/Catholic) 

```{r}
chisq.test(chi_counts)
```
H0: No significant association between categories(political affiliation and religious affiliation are independent)

P is very very small so we reject the null hypothesis. 

- There is a significant association between partyid and religious affiliation ($\chi^2$ = `r`)

- Party identificaiton and religious affiliation are NOT independent of one another

- Religious affiliation (none / Catholic) differed significantly between strong democrats and strong republicans

- Proportions of people identifying as either athiest or Catholic differed significantly for Strong Republicans or Strong Democrats
